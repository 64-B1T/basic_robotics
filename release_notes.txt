Version 0.3.36 - The Plotting Update

Despite the name, there are also significant changes to the serial arm class, but most are to plotting functionality.

General
    Screw
        - Added reshape method for legacy code support.
    Wrench 
        - Allow for Wrenches to be instantiated with no arguments.
Kinematics 
    Arm 
        - Added documentation throughout the file, brought documentation into styling conformity.
        - Fixed a discovered bug in 'move' which duplicated the screw list, such that if the arm was moved
            twice, it would result in incorrect joint position outputs. It was not apparent in moving an arm's 
            base location *once,* leading to delays in locating the bug.
        - Changed order of arguments for staticForcesWithLinkMasses. Theta and wrench are now optional (uses default configuration).
        - Made 'grav' and 'end_effector_wrench' optional in inverseDynamicsEMR, default to current config.
        - Made 'grav' and 'end_effector_wrench' optional in inverseDynamics, default to current config.
        - Reintegrated InverseDynamicsC into one function.
        - massMatrix theta argument is now optional.
        - removed endEffectorForces, as it is a specialized call of inverseDynamics and therefore unneeded.
Plotting
    vis_3js_client
        - created a class inheritance system for objects which can be drawn on 3JS viewer.
            VisPlot
            v 
            |--- PrimitivePlot
            |    v
            |    |--- CubePlot
            |    |--- AxesPlot
            |    |--- TubePlot
            |
            |--- RobotPlot
                 v
                 |--- ArmPlot
                 |--- SPPlot 
        - Visplot interface allows for default configurations and more automation 
        - Allows for running visualizers without full imports 
        - documentation completed and standardized.
        - Updates for objects transitioned into list comprehensions before building updated dicts.
    vis_3js_server 
        - Server can be run through command line without package import 
        - default 3d volumes are now referenced via 'local' to account for non-standard installation locations and different OSes 
        - documentation completed and standardized
    vis_matplotlib
        - function naming standardized to snakeCase. Alternate handles retained for now for backwards compatibility
        - documentation completed and standardized.
