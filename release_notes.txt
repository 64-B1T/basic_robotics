Version 0.3.18 - New Features... 
"The Robot Generalization Update"

Implemented Robot base class "Robot" presenting a series of methods applicable to the generalized robot, 
somewhat standardizing interfaces between stewart platforms, serial arms, and any potential future robot model 
class that implements the methods in class "Robot"

Robot Super Class! 
    - Includes handles for:
        - Forward and Inverse Kinematics 
        - Space and Body Forward and Inverse Jacobians 
        - Space and Body Forward and Inverse Static Forces
        - Getting End Effector and Base Positions 
        - And more....
    - Can fill in if some functions are not defined in a new robot model, such as deriving the 
            following capabilities from just jacobian or inverse jacobian defined:
        - StaticForces (Forward and Inverse, Body and Space)
        - Jacobian (inverse of defined, space and body)

Arm 
    - Some functions and variables moved to Robot superclass in unionization effort, but compatability is unchanged.

Stewart Platforms received a lot of love for this update, bringing some changes
    - Internal handler _setPlatePos used for all state changes of both plates
    - Reversed ordering of arguments in IK, IKHelper ... such that the top_plate_pos argument is first. 
        This enables simple calling of IK without named arguments, with one argument only, inline with the format in Serial Arm
        Example: sp.IK(goal) instead of sp.IK(top_plate_pos=goal) or sp.IK(tm(), goal)
    - Changed structure of 'reverse' for Forward Kinematics, removed unused reverse parameter from FKSolve and FKRaphson
    - Documentation
        - Typehints added to all functions both in function definitions and docstrings
    - Misc Tweaks 
        - Removed unused protection argument from IKHelper
        - reoirentTopPlate deleted, functionality integrated into fixUpsideDown

    - Function Definitions Changed
        - inverseJacobianSpace (and all jacobian functions) order changed to top_plate, bottom_plate

    - Functions Deleted:
        - jacobianSpace -> handled by base class Robot (under handle jacobian)
        - altInverseJacobianSpace -> top down inverse jacobian is directly related to bottom up
        - measureForcesFromWrenchEE -> Redundant
        - carryMassCalcUp -> Niche/Redundant
        - measureForcesFromBottomEE -> Niche/Redundant 
        - wrenchBottomFromMeasuredForces -> Niche/Redundant

    - Functions with Changed Names:
        - measureForcesAtEENew -> staticForces (to conform to base class Robot)
        - measureForcesFromWrenchEE -> staticForces (to conform to base class Robot)
        - measureForcesFromBottomEE -> staticForces(reverse = True)
        - wrenchEEFromMeasuredForces -> staticForcesInv (to conform to base class Robot)

    - Functions made private:
            - IKHelper -> _IKHelper 
            - FKSolve -> _FKSolve (Access through FK with appropriate mode switch)
            - FKRaphson -> _FKRaphson (Access through FK with appropriate mode switch)
            - lambdaTopPlateReorientation -> _lambdaTopPlateReorientation
            - fixUpsideDown -> _fixUpsideDown
