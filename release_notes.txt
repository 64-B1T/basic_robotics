Version 0.3.19 - Patches and Features 

Hit 75% unit test coverage of entire package. Moving out of kinematics for unit test focuses. 

General 
    - Added a frame argument for makeWrench(... frame_applied = tm())
Kinematics 
    - robot_model (Robot)
        - added in velocityAtEndEffector and velocityAtJoints functionalities
        - completed documentation and style edits
    - arm_model (Arm)
        - velocity functions transferred to robot base class. Functionality improved, compatibility unchanged.
    - sp_model (SP)
        - carryMassCalcLocal renamed carryMassCalcBody to maintain convention ("" and "Body" to denote space and Body)
        - private functions moved to bottom of the class and grouped by type
        - completed documentation and style edits
        - All state variables moved to private 
        - added draw and randomPos functions to SP class inline with Robot requirements
        - patched midHeightEstimate to find true home pose. (I guess now it's midHeightPrecise)
Plotting 
    - drawSP patched to account for changes in sp_model 
    - visClient patched to account for changes in sp_model
